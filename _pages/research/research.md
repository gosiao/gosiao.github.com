I am broadly interested in quantum chemistry and its applications to model properties of molecules, in particular the ones involving heavy elements, responding to various perturbations and interacting with other molecules in the environment.

I am particularly enthusiastic about combining data science and computer science with chemistry. At the intersection of these domains I am looking for ways to improve computational quantum chemistry workflows, as well as for new methods contributing to a deeper understanding of the behavior of molecular systems in complex environments and under perturbations.
