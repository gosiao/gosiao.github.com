Last few weeks I have spent quite some time chasing bugs in a large, Fortran-based code, which also seem to be compiler/OS/environment-dependent. The whole process is nerve-racking - the frustration of persistent errors in test jobs, the confusion when the bug cannot be pinned to one place in the code, the anxiety due to the delayed production, finally - the curiosity of how this software testing process unfolds.
As software testing grew to be one of my interests over the last few years, I decided to dive into it more systematically and identify the processes that can be automatized and executed in a more well thought-through manner (and without so much frustration). My companion in active learning of software testing is an online course - [SmartTesting](https://smarttesting.pl) (available in Polish). I will soon write more about my impressions from this course, but for now, I can say that already the first few modules helped to organize all I read over the years in my head.
Over the next few blog posts, I will share what I learn. I want to transfer that knowledge to scientific software testing - so for instance paying more attention to numerics or code execution in parallel environments.
