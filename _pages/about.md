Currently I am a researcher in the Centre of New Technologies at the University of Warsaw and on this website I am writing about [my research interests](/research/research.md), keeping track of [published papers](publications.md) and [software](software.md), and hosting a list of [links](links.md) I find particularly useful in everyday research. 

Occasionally, on the [blog](news.md) I write about:

* events related to quantum chemistry, programming and data analysis
* comments on books, papers, articles, talks
* technicalities, little pieces of code, settings I find useful in everyday work
* lists of ideas and inspirations
* and various other topics.
