[//]: # look for research statement examples online

[//]: # one of the functions of a research plan is to demonstrate your intellectual vision and aspirations. It's also an opportunity to begin to demonstrate the creative and independent thinking required of a successful scientist.


I am broadly interested in quantum chemistry and its applications to model properties of molecules, in particular the ones involving heavy elements, responding to various perturbations and interacting with other molecules in the environment.

My primary interests are in combining data science and computer science with chemistry. At the intersection of these domains I am looking for ways to improve the computational quantum chemistry workflows, as well as for new methods contributing to a deeper understanding of the behavior of molecular systems in complex environments and under perturbations.

* [Topological Data Analysis of quantum chemistry data](tda_and_qchem)
* [Molecules in realistic environments - the Frozen Density Embedding ](fde)
