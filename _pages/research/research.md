[//]: # look for research statement examples online

I am interested in combining data science and computer science with chemistry as a way to improve methods and computational workflows used in quantum chemistry calculations. 
This is motivated not only by an utilitarian incentives to optimize and facilitate such calculations, but is also led by a curiosity in looking

for new ways to understand the behavior of complex molecular systems in complex environments and under various perturbations.

Currently working on:

* [Topological Data Analysis of quantum chemistry data](tda_in_qchem)
