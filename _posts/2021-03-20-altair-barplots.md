The first day of spring seems like a good time to finally launch a series 'Things I learned this week':)
Today I'd like to share a way to do a stacked and grouped bar plot with [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html).

This post can be viewed as a jupyter notebook - [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gosiao/notebooks/blob/main/altair_stacked_grouped_sorted_barchart/notebook.ipynb).
