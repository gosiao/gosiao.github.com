title: "Molecules in realistic environments"
author_profile: false
---


A way to learn about the electronic structure and properties of a molecule is through the interations of this molecule with other molecules in its environment and with various external perturbations.
Studying molecules in such "realistic environments" also allows for a better understanding of their behavior under specific, complex conditions.

Computer simulations of such ensembles is not an easy task. The applicability of quantum chemistry methods is limited due to the unfavorable scaling,,,



 from ncn project description:

The main objective of this project is to develop ab-initio quantum chemistry protocol, which will allow to calculate various molecular properties (manifested in multiple spectroscopic techniques) for molecules involving heavy atoms in realistic environments, e.g. in condensed phases or on interfaces.
The project involves the development of methodology, as well as its efficient implementation, testing and application to real-life molecular systems.


**Research project methodology**
The methodology should include the relativistic effects (scalar and spin-orbit), have a good description of electron correlation and, finally, should account for the presence of an environment, which may significantly affect the geometry, electronic structure and properties of the molecule of interest.
More advanced quantum chemistry methods which are able to encompass the relativistic and electron correlation effects are computationally very expensive, therefore cannot be used to a molecule and its environment treated as whole system. A promising alternative is to use embedding methods, in which the whole system is divided into subsystems: an \emph{active} molecule of interest and its environment, treated separately by the best quantum chemistry models. The developments in this project are based on the frozen density embedding (FDE), in which this partitioning is performed in terms of the electron density and the effect of all other subsystems on the molecule for which the electronic structure and properties are sought is accounted for through the so-called embedding potential. FDE is based on the density functional theory (DFT), therefore the embedding potential is defined analogously to exchange--correlation potential in Kohn--Sham DFT, nevertheless all the subsystems can either be described with DFT or with wave-funtion theory (WFT) based methods, what results in various embedding schemes, termed DFT-in-DFT, WFT-in-DFT, WFT-in-WFT.

Currently available FDE schemes are limitted to non-relativistic or quasi-relativistic Hamiltonians and only to few molecular properties (not higher than of second-order). This project will fill this gap - the developments will be made in the \emph{fully}-relativistic four-component (4c) framework with the Dirac--Coulomb (DC) Hamiltonian and various DFT and WFT methods for the wide range of second- and third-order molecular properties.

This extension is essential to systems with heavy atoms and to properties which depend on the electron density near the nucleus - as for them the relativistic effects are expected to be significant -- such as the properties observed in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy or in the X-ray spectroscopy, however owing to recent advancements in relativistic quantum chemistry, more unexpected examples of significant relativistic effects on valence properties are found.
The proposed methodology will therefore allow to revisit and calculate various properties, notably in systems with heavy elements, with the relativistic, correlation and environmental effects calculated from the start.


**Expected impact of the research project on the development of science, civilization and society**

The project is related to basic research and will make significant contributions to understanding the electronic structure of complex molecular systems with heavy elements present.
As it deals with molecules in realistic environments, it has potentially endless applications in various research fields in biology and chemistry.
In addition, heavy elements are used in many applications of the strategic importance for the sustainable future of the modern society. Examples include applications in medicine (radiopharmaceuticals, nuclear imaging agents) and various industries (catalysts, photonic devices, single molecular magnets), energy sources (nuclear fuels), to name but a few.

The knowledge of electronic structure and properties of molecules with heavy elements in complex environments is the first step in an efficient design of functional molecular materials and drugs. Among various applications, this project will consider systems which can be used as chemical sensors, molecule-based materials of desired magnetic properties or as radiopharmaceuticals.
