**About:**

An often used criterion of the existence of non-covalent bonds is the presence of the bond critical point (BCP) between atoms involved in such interaction. This *yes-no* criterion has been questioned in literature on multiple occasions, yet is still frequently used without deeper inquiries. 
The gold complexes considered in this project, ...., are examples of systems in which the false conclusions on the non-covalent interactions are drawn from the presence of BCPs, identified in the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) as saddle points of the electron density. 
The Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offers a new perspective to the interpretation of topological features of the electron density. While it extracts the same topological features as QTAIM, it quantifies them by *persistence* - a real number associated with their importance. An interesting observation is that the persistence of saddle point pairs depends on the accuracy
