Currently I am a researcher in the Centre of New Technologies at the University of Warsaw and on this website I am writing about [my research interests](/research/research.md), keeping track of [published papers](publications.md) and [software](software.md), and hosting a list of [links](links.md) I find particularly useful in everyday research. 

Occasionally, I [blog](news.md) about various scientific initiatives, books and technicalities.
I organize [hands-on workshops](https://comp-sci-tools.github.io/) on best practices in computational sciences.
