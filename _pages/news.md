**Open positions**

If you are interested in working at the intersection of quantum chemistry and data science and looking for an internship, a Ph.D./M.Sc./B.Sc. thesis project, or a postdoc position, contact me at "malgorzata.olejniczak [at] cent.uw.edu.pl".
The openings for 2023 are offered within the SONATA BIS Grant (National Science Centre Poland) in the project titled "Embedding methods in quantum chemistry - pushing the boundaries of modeling molecular properties of complex systems with heavy elements."
